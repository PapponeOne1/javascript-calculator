## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## How It Works

This calculator uses JavaScript to handle button clicks and perform arithmetic operations. The current number, previous number, and selected operator are stored in variables. When the user clicks the equals button, the calculator performs the operation and displays the result.

## Future Improvements

- Implement a dark mode toggle
- Add keyboard support for number and operator input
- Display the complete calculation as a history above the display area
